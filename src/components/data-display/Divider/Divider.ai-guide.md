# Divider AI Guide

## Purpose
The Divider component is an internal wrapper for MUI Divider, ensuring consistent usage, theming, and abstraction across the codebase. It is used to separate content visually and semantically, supporting both horizontal and vertical orientations.

## Architecture
- **Wrapper**: Composes MUI's Divider, forwarding all props.
- **Props**: Accepts orientation, variant, color, flexItem, className, style, and any additional props.
- **Theming**: Supports custom color via style prop, integrates with theme palette.
- **Accessibility**: Uses correct semantic elements and supports ARIA attributes.

## Usage Patterns
- Use `<Divider />` for horizontal separation in lists, cards, and layouts.
- Use `<Divider orientation="vertical" />` for vertical separation in toolbars or flex layouts.
- Prefer the internal Divider over direct MUI imports for consistency and future-proofing.

## Advanced
- Can be extended with custom styles or variants as needed.
- Supports flex layouts via `flexItem` prop.

## Testing
- Ensure Divider renders with correct orientation and variant.
- Test custom color and style application.
- Verify accessibility attributes are passed through.
