# Drawer Component UX Analysis & Improvement Plan

## Current Issues Identified

### 1. **Button Overlap Problem**
- **Issue**: The "Close Drawer" button appears to be overlapping with drawer content
- **Root Cause**: Z-index conflicts and positioning issues in DrawerWrapper
- **Impact**: Poor usability, content obscured

### 2. **Scrolling Issues**
- **Issue**: Visible scrollbars in drawer content area affecting visual appeal
- **Root Cause**: Default overflow settings without UX consideration
- **Impact**: Cluttered appearance, unprofessional look

### 3. **Styling Inconsistencies**
- **Issue**: Lack of primary color variants for headers
- **Root Cause**: Limited theming options in current implementation
- **Impact**: Monotonous appearance, poor brand integration

### 4. **Layout Problems**
- **Issue**: Fixed positioning conflicts between button and drawer
- **Root Cause**: Absolute positioning without proper spacing calculations
- **Impact**: Content accessibility issues
